**QuickKart** is a US-based e-commerce company specializing in curated lifestyle products, tech gadgets, and household essentials. Founded with the mission of bringing speed and simplicity to online shopping, QuickKart combines high-quality products with fast delivery and personalized customer experiences.

As a digitally native brand, QuickKart invests heavily in data-driven marketing to enhance customer acquisition and conversion. Operating nationwide, the company is expanding its reach through targeted advertising on major social media platforms.

Currently, QuickKart is conducting an A/B test to evaluate the performance of a **new digital advertising campaign (Test Campaign)** compared to the **existing approach (Control Campaign)**. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include website clicks, add-to-cart actions, purchases, and cost per purchase. Your analysis will guide the Marketing Director’s decision on whether to roll out the test campaign more broadly to maximize ROI.

## Project Overview

To improve the performance of QuickKart’s digital advertising, an A/B test has been launched by the Marketing Director to compare the **existing campaign (Control Campaign)** with a **newly developed approach (Test Campaign)**.

## Objective

- Evaluating whether the **test campaign** leads to improved user engagement and conversion—specifically:
  - Website clicks
  - Add-to-cart actions
  - Purchases
- Measuring the cost-efficiency of the **test campaign** via cost per purchase.
- Conducting statistical tests to determine if differences between the campaigns are significant.
- Delivering actionable, data-driven insights to support a decision on whether to scale the **test campaign** across additional initiatives.

The results will be critical for the Marketing Director to determine if the **test campaign** should be adopted more widely.

## Analysis Approach

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
